        <p>
            My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire: I was the third of five sons. He sent me to
            Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old, where I resided three years, and applied
            myself close to my studies; but the charge of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty
            allowance, being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James Bates,
            an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued four years. My father now and then
            sending me small sums of money, I laid them out in learning navigation, and other parts of
            the mathematics, useful to those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be, some
            time or other, my fortune to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my father: where, by the
            assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other relations, I got forty pounds, and a
            promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years
            and seven months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.
        <p>

        <p>
            Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master, Mr. Bates, to be
            surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannel, commander; with whom I continued three
            years and a half, making a voyage or two into the Levant, and some other parts. When I came
            back I resolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged me, and by
            him I was recommended to several patients. I took part of a small house in the Old Jewry; and
            being advised to alter my condition, I married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr.
            Edmund Burton, hosier, in Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a
            portion.
        <p>

        <p>
            But my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few friends, my business
            began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many
            among my brethren. Having therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my
            acquaintance, I determined to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two ships, and
            made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by which I got some addition
            to my fortune. My hours of leisure I spent in reading the best authors, ancient and modern,
            being always provided with a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing
            the manners and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language; wherein I had
            a great facility, by the strength of my memory.
        <p>

        <p>
            The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the sea, and intended to
            stay at home with my wife and family. I removed from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from
            thence to Wapping, hoping to get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to
            account. After three years expectation that things would mend, I accepted an advantageous
            offer from Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope, who was making a voyage to the
            South Sea. We set sail from Bristol, May 4, 1699, and our voyage was at first very prosperous.
